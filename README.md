# Unofficial U.S. State Department Travel Advisory REST API
Super simple REST api for getting the current travel advisories put out by the U.S. State Department.
Data is sourced from the official RSS feed provided by the State Department (https://travel.state.gov/_res/rss/TAsTWs.xml).
This is not an official resource, so use at your own risk! Rate limiting for the hosted endpoint is outlined in the included
`.env` file.
